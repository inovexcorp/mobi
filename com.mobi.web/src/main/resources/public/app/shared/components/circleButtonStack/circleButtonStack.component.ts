/**
 * @class shared.CircleButtonStackComponent
 * 
 * A component that creates a Material Fab button (`mat-fab`) which reveals transcluded content on hover. The
 * transcluded content is expected to be a series of `mat-mini-fab` buttons with icons inside that perform a variety of
 * actions on click ending with a `mat-fab` button to replace the main button. Best practice is color each button
 * differently and to also use `matTooltip` on each button to provide context as to what the button will do.
 * 
 * @usage
 * <circle-button-stack>
 *     <button mat-mini-fab color="accent" [matTooltip]="Secondary Action"><mat-icon>local_offer</mat-icon></button>
 *     <button mat-mini-fab color="primary" [matTooltip]="Main Action"><mat-icon>add</mat-icon></button>
 * </circle-button-stack>
