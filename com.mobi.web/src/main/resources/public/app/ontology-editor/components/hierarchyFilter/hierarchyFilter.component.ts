/**
 * @class ontology-editor.HierarchyFilterComponent
 *
 * `hierarchyFilter` is a component that displays a filter icon that opens a dropdown when clicked. The dropdown has a checkbox for each filter that was passed in the filters object to the component.
 *
 * @param {Object[]} filters An array of objects that represents filters. This component expects each filter to have both a flag property to denote whether a filter has been applied and a checked property to denote whether the checkbox associated with the filter has been checked. Each filter should also have a property called filter that contains a function that is the logic for the actual filter matching. Each filter should also have a name property that is used to display the name of the filter next to its checkbox.
 * @param {Function} updateFilters A function to update the filters array in the parent scope.
 * @param {Function} submitEvent A function to apply the filters in the filters array.
