/**
 * @class PathNodeDisplayComponent
 * 
 * A component which recursively generates a display of the provided {@link PathNode} and all its sub-nodes. Simple IRI
 * nodes are shown as a single `mat-card` with an arrow indicating whether it is a normal predicate path or an inverse. 
 * ZeroOrMore, OneOrMore, and ZeroOrOne nodes are displayed with a bounding fieldset element with a label.
 * Alternative nodes display their sub nodes side by side with "OR" in between. Sequence nodes are just shown one after
 * another downwards. The topmost use of the component will generally only provide the `pathNode` binding and the
 * addNodeToParent output function. All other bindings are used by the recursive logic. Include buttons for adding new
 * nodes to the path.
 * 
 * @param {PathNode} pathNode The node in question that should be displayed
 * @param {PathNode} parentNode The PathNode that pointed to this one. Set by Sequence, Inverse, ZeroOrMore, OneOrMore,
 *    and ZeroOrOne parent nodes
 * @param {boolean} [inverse=false] Whether this node was pointed at inversely. Only taken into account on IRI nodes.
 *    Set by Inverse parent nodes.
 * @param {boolean} [showAdd=true] Whether the add button beneath an IRI node should be displayed. Set by Alternative
 *    parent nodes
 * @param {number} [seqIdx=0] The index of this node in its parent Sequence node. Set by Sequence parent nodes
 * @param {Function} addNodeToParent A function that will emit when the add button is clicked beneath or to the side of
 *    a node. Expects an argument in the shape of an object with keys for `parentNode`, `seqIdx`, and `sibling`
